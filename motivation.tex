\section{Motivation}

As a motivation example, consider...

Here we give an example to motivate our work. E.g. assuming we have a zero-cost profiling based work metric,
how can we use it to perform iterative compilation across runs? Then we talk about while it is impossible to
build a zero-overhead metric, we can develop one with low overhead.
