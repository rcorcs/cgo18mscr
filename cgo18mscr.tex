\section{Introduction}

Modern optimising compilers have reached a high level of sophistication, providing a large number of optimisations.
Because of the unpredictability of optimisation interactions, in addition to the growing complexity of processor architectures and applications, the correct choice of optimisations and their ordering can have a significant impact on the performance of the code being optimised~\cite{pan06,fursin07,kulkarni12}.

Each of these optimisations interacts with the code in complicated ways, depending on all other optimisations and the order they were applied to the code being optimised.
Understanding the interactions of optimisations is very important in determining a good solution to the phase-ordering problem~\cite{touati06,kulkarni12}.
Because of all those dependencies and interactions, although most compiler optimisations yield significant improvements in many programs, the potential for performance degradation in certain program patterns is known to compiler writers and many users~\cite{pan06,zhou12,kulkarni12}.
%Traditional compilers typically apply the same set of optimisation in a fixed order to all functions in a program, without regard the code being optimised.

Efficiently selecting the best combination of compiler optimisations for a given program or program section remains an open problem.
Compiler writers typically use a combination of experience and insight to construct the default sequences of prearranged optimisations found in compilers.
However, these default pre-arranged set of optimisations do not include all possible optimisations and they are always applied in the same pre-defined fixed order, without regard the code being optimised~\cite{pan06,cavazos07,zhou12,kulkarni12}.
%in hopes that a programmer will know which combination of optimisations will benefit their code~\cite{pan06,cavazos07,zhou12,kulkarni12}.

A well known compilation technique that addresses this challenge is {\itercomp}.
{\Itercomp} has the ability to adapt to new platforms, program and workload while still having a systematic and simple optimisation process.
It works by repeatedly evaluating a large number of compiler optimisations until the best combination is found for a particular program~\cite{fursin07,chen10}.
The main challenge concerning {\itercomp} is the need for efficiently exploring such a large optimisation space~\cite{fursin07,cavazos07,zhou12}.

Until recently, most of existing work  had been focusing on finding the best optimisation through repeated runs using a single input.
Although they demonstrate the potential of {\itercomp}, in real scenarios the user rarely executes the same input dataset multiple times~\cite{bodin98,kisuki99,stephenson03,kulkarni04,agakov06}.
Applying {\itercomp} in light of a single input may not result in good performance when executing the optimised code with different inputs.

Most of real world applications are complex enough so that a single input case does not capture the whole range of possible scenarios and program behaviour~\cite{haneda06,fursin07,chen10,chen12a}.
Because programs can exhibit behaviours that differ greatly depending on the input,
%This is something that is well known when writing test cases for correctness.
%We can extend the same argument when optimising the code for performance.
using a single input for {\itercomp} can produce poor performance when executed with different inputs.

Recent work have been studying the impact of using multiple input datasets
for performing {\itercomp}.
This previous work suggests that optimising based on a representative range of input datasets allows for selecting a robust compiler optimisation that produces good performance in real scenarios where the input is expected to change constantly~\cite{haneda06,fursin07,chen10,chen12a,chen12b,fang15,mpeis16}.
Their results show that a limited number of input datasets may be sufficient to obtain a well optimised program for a wider range of different inputs~\cite{haneda06,fursin07,chen10,chen12a}.

Finding such a robust combination of compiler optimisations by means of {\itercomp} across a large range of inputs may be very time consuming.
In order to speed up this process we intend to reduce the number of actual executions during the exploration of the optimisation space without much degradation of the final selected optimisation.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/infra-diagram}
    \caption{Overview of the execution engine for applying {\itercomp}.}
    \label{fig:infra-diagram}
\end{figure}

In this paper, our main goal is to enable {\itercomp} in \textit{online} scenarios with the restriction of executing distinct inputs only once, while targeting optimal performance across different inputs.
This online aspect is usually found in mobile and data centre platforms~\cite{chen12b,fang15,mpeis16}, where the goal is to optimise programs based on the workload of a particular user (or group of users) between executions.

Measuring just execution time, for example, is useful only if the amount of work is constant between executions with different inputs.
For this reason, we propose the use of a work-based metric in order to compare the performance of different optimisations across multiple executions of the program with distinct inputs.

Because of the restriction of not repeating inputs, we instrument the program for measuring the amount of work it performed during its execution.
Having a low overhead instrumentation is essential in this online scenario for two main reasons:
$(i)$ the user is directly affected by large overheads;
$(ii)$ a highly intrusive instrumentation can havea significant impact on the effect of the optimisations.

Our main contributions are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The use of a work-based performance metric in order to enable \textit{online} {\itercomp} by comparing different combination of compiler optimisations even when executed with distinct inputs.
\item We propose a relaxed instrumentation for low overhead profiling, with a controlled trade-off between accuracy and overhead.
\end{itemize}

\section{Work-based Metric} \label{sec:metric}

In this section we define the work-based performance metric used in this paper.
We define the performance metric as the ratio between the amount of \textit{work}, $\Delta W$, performed during a period of time, $\Delta t$.
\[
   P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}
\]

%The hypothesis is that, given two optimisations $o_1$ and $o_2$, a program compiled with optimisation $o_2$ would \textit{consistently} perform better than when it is compiled with $o_1$, i.e., $o_1 \tilde{<}_p \, o_2$, if it performs more \textit{work} per unit of time when compiled with $o_2$ instead of $o_1$. 
By measuring the amount of \textit{work} done per unit of time we reduce the impact of input-dependent aspects and focus instead on the efficiency of the optimised program.
For this metric, the main challenge is to precisely define what represents \textit{work}.

%For that purpose, we intend to use profiling techniques to measure the input size and amount of computation performed on the execution path triggered by the input~\cite{ball94,ball96,zaparanuks12,coppa14}.

%In addition to being useful for speeding up {\itercomp} across a large number of different inputs, this metric based on comparing work-based efficiencies could
%potentially be used for applying {\itercomp} \textit{online}.
%However, the overhead for estimating the amount of \textit{work} must be low enough for the performance gains to be beneficial.

We model the computational work $\Delta W$ as a linear equation based on block frequency information and a cost-model of the instruction set.
\[
\Delta W = \varepsilon + \sum_{B} w(B)f(B)
\]
where $f(B)$ represents the frequency of basic block $B$ and $w(B)$ represents the computational work of executing $B$.
We define the work of a basic block $B$ as the sum of the cost of its instructions, i.e.,
\[
w(B) = \sum_{i} w_i N_B(i)
\]
where $w_i$ is the cost of instruction $i$ and $N_B(i)$ is the number of occurrences of instruction $i$ in basic block $B$.

In this simplified model, we consider that $w_i$ is constant across all programs and executions in the given target platform.
However, $N_B(i)$ is program dependent but constant across executions, while $f(B)$ is both program and execution dependent, since $f(B)$ can change when executing with different inputs.
In other words, $N_B(i)$ is a static value known at compile-time and $f(B)$ is a dynamic value known only at run-time.
%If we define $x_i$ as
%\[
%x_i = \sum_{B\in P} N_B(i)f(B)
%\]
%we can write our definition of work $\Delta W$ as the following linear equation
%\[
%\Delta W = \varepsilon + \sum_{i\in I} w_i x_i
%\]

Similarly to previous work~\cite{giusto01,powell09,brandolese11}, we derive the cost model for the instruction set by modelling the problem as a multi-variable linear regression, where the \textit{regression coefficients} are the costs of the instructions and the \textit{regressors} (or \textit{explanatory variables}) are computed as $\sum_B N_B(i)f(B)$ for each instruction $i$.
\[
\Delta W = \varepsilon + \sum_{i} \left(w_i \sum_{B} N_B(i)f(B)\right)
\]

By having some empirical data after executing several benchmarks with different inputs, we can fit the linear model with this empirical data in order to obtain the costs of the instructions.

\section{Instrumentation}

In this section we describe how the computation of the work-metric can be performed during runtime by means of instrumenting the code.
In particular, we adapt the optimal algorithm proposed originally for profiling block frequency~\cite{knuth73,ball94}.
Afterwards, we propose a relaxed instrumentation that focus on further reducing the overhead by considering the trade-off between profiling accuracy and instrumentation overhead.

Because we define work as a linear equation on the block frequency counters, it is possible to embed its computation into the execution of the program.
A naive instrumentation would consists basically of having a global counter that starts with the interception value, $\varepsilon$, and each basic block increments its own cost into the global counter.
Although this instrumentation is easily implemented, it inserts a large amount of overhead into the program.
However, it is possible to insert fewer probes by carefully placing the probes in a way that is possible to reconstruct the complete profiling information~\cite{knuth73,ball94}.

Ball and Larus~\cite{ball94} show that a set of edges represents the minimum number of probes for profiling block frequency if and only if the complementary set of edges forms a spanning tree.
The instrumentation optimises the placement of the probes with respect to a weighing that assigns a non-negative value to each edge in the CFG.
The cost of profiling a set of edges is proportional to the sum of the weights of the edges.
These weights can be obtained either by empirical measurements or heuristic estimations.
In order to minimise the profiling cost, the instrumentation computes the maximum spanning tree for avoiding probing in frequently executed edges.
Although this instrumentation algorithm is proved to produce the optimal placement of probes for well-structured CFGs, it may produce sub-optimal placement for some unstructured CFGs.

Once we have the maximum spanning tree, probes are placed on any edge not in the spanning tree. Figure~\ref{fig:cfg-example} shows an example of a CFG with a maximum spanning tree represented by the black edges, while the edges highlighted in red represent the placement of the probes.

  \caption{Example of a CFG with its minimum spanning tree in black and the
   basic blocks highlighted in red represent the instrumented basic blocks with
   the placement of the probes.}
  \label{fig:cfg-example}
\end{figure}

In contrast to the naive instrumentation where each basic block records only its own amount of work, with the optimal profiling, the instrumented basic blocks need record an aggregated value of work that represents a path in the CFG.
These values are constructed with some instrumented basic blocks speculatively assuming some paths while other probes correct when these assumptions are wrong (see for example $w(P_0)$ and $w(P_1)$ in Figure~\ref{fig:cfg-example}).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Post-processing of the CFG for populating all edge flows based on the collected probes.}, label={lst:populateEdgeFlows}, float]
// Inputs: CFG with the known edges flows from
//         the cotree (collected probes).
// Output: Updated CFG with all edge flows.
populateEdgeFlows(G) {
  changed = true
  while changed:
    changed = false
    for B in G.vertices():
      unIN = count( G.unknownIncomingEdges(B) )
      unOUT = count( G.unknownOutgoingEdges(B) )
      if unIN==0 and unOUT==1:
        //sum known incoming and outgoing edges
        sIN = sum( G.incomingEdges(B) )
        sOUT = sum( G.outgoingEdges(B) )
        //update unknown outgoing edge in B
        //with (sIN-sOUT)
        G.setUnknownOutgoingEdge(B, (sIN-sOUT))
        changed = true
      if unIN==1 and unOUT==0:
        //sum known incoming and outgoing edges
        sIN = sum( G.incomingEdges(B) )
        sOUT = sum( G.outgoingEdges(B) )
        //update unknown incoming edge in B
        //with (sOUT-sIN)
        G.setUnknownIncomingEdge(B, (sOUT-sIN))
        changed = true
}
\end{lstlisting}


Because the algorithm for the optimal placement of the probes is proved to uniquely compute the block frequencies by propagating the probe counts, we adapt this algorithm in order to compose the aggregated values that will be instrumented in each probe, based on our model of computational work, $\Delta W$, derived from the basic block frequencies (see Section~\ref{sec:metric}).
We perform a similar propagation of the probes in a symbolic fashion, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:cfg-example}.
This symbolic propagation of the probes is implemented by the data-flow analysis described in Algorithm~\ref{alg:populateEdgeInfo}, and the final aggregated values are extracted from the edge information as described by Algorithm~\ref{alg:instrValue}.

The data-flow analysis in Algorithm~\ref{alg:populateEdgeInfo} keeps two sets for each edge, namely, the increment and the decrement sets.
We consider that both sets represent the \textit{edge expressions} shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cfg-example}, for which we define a \textit{symbolic sum} by computing the union of the increment and decrement sets, respectively, with the appropriate cancellation of common elements.
This data-flow analysis is based on the invariant that the symbolic sum of all the incoming edges must equals the symbolic sum of the outgoing edges.
For example, the symbolic sum of the incoming edges of the basic block $B_8$ is $P_0 - P_1$, where $P_3$ is cancelled out.

%By construction, the \textit{symbolic experssions} of a basic block, i.e., the \textit{symbolic sum} of the incoming edges (or outgoing edges) of a basic block, has the following properties:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Probes in the increment set either (post-)dominates or is (post-)dominated by the given basic block;
%\item Probes in the decrement set are (post-)dominated by the probes in the increment set;
%\item Probes in the decrement set and the given basic block are in exclusive paths from the virtual node of the CFG to the (post-)dominators in the increment set;
%\end{enumerate}
%From property (1) it follows that whenever the given basic block is executed, exactly one of the probes in the increment set is executed.
%From properties (2) and (3), it follows that whenever a probe in the decrement set is executed, although the given basic block is not executed, one of the probes in the decrement set is executed.

Algorithm~\ref{alg:instrValue} reads the edge information for each basic block by computing the symbolic sum of their respective incoming edges (or outgoing edges).
From these \textit{edge expressions}, we are able to compose the aggregated value of the probes.
The positive terms in the edge expression of a basic block indicate that the amount of work of this basic block will be incremented in the probes represented by these positive terms, similarly, the negative terms indicate that the amount of work of this basic block will be decremented in the probes represented by these negative terms.
For example, because the edge expression for the basic block $B_8$ is $P_0 - P_1$, the amount of work of $B_8$, denoted by $w(B_8)$, is incremented in probe $P_0$ and decremented in $P_1$.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pseudocode that describes how the edge information is used in order to extract the value that will be computed in a given instrumented basic block $B_I$. This algorithm could equally be implemented based on the predecessors.}, label={lst:instrValue}, float]
// Inputs: 1) CFG with the known edges flows
//            of the chords.
//         2) Basic block targeted for probing.
// Output: Work value to be incremented by the
//         given probe B.
instrValue(G, B, inc, dec) {
  value = 0
  for B in G.vertices():
    incB = set()
    decB = set()
    for succB in G.successor(B):
      incB = incB union inc[G.getEdge(B, succB)]
      decB = decB union dec[G.getEdge(B, succB)]
    if B in (incB - decB):
      value = value + w(B)
    if B in (decB - incB):
      value = value - w(B)
  return value
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Relaxed Instrumentation}

Although the optimal instrumentation significantly reduces the profiling overhead when compared to the naive instrumentation, from an average overhead of 79\% to 13\%, in some critical cases, even the optimal instrumentation can have an overhead of about 70\% (see benchmark \texttt{adpcm\_d} in Figure~\ref{fig:overhead-O3}).
In order to further reduce the overhead in these critical cases, we propose a relaxed instrumentation by trading off accuracy and overhead.

%\begin{figure*}[htb]
%    \centering
%    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/overhead-O0.pdf}
%    \caption{Comparison between the naive and optimal instrumentation
%              with no compiler optimisation.}
%    \label{fig:overhead-O0}
%\end{figure*}

%Define an extended DAG of a CFG as a directed graph which may contain cycles if they have known constant trip counts.

The relaxed instrumentation performs a post-processing on the resulting instrumentation of the optimal algorithm.
The relaxation starts by extracting \textit{extended} DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) from the CFG, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:cfg-relax-example}.
Each loop (and the outer most region of the function) represents an extended DAG where any inner loop is considered to never execute, i.e. only the headers of the inner loops are included into the extended DAG.

%
%LLVM has a Scalar Evolution Analysis which is used primarily to analyse expressions involving induction variables in loops~\cite{pop05}.
%An induction variable is a variable that is increased or decreased by a fixed amount on every iteration of a loop or is a linear function of another induction variable.
%
%This Scalar Evolution Analysis provides a way to compute \textit{small} constant trip counts (where \textit{small} is defined by a threshold).

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{figs/cfg-relax-example.pdf}
  \caption{Example of a CFG containing a loop and its decomposition into extended DAGs when applying the relaxation.}
  \label{fig:cfg-relax-example}
\end{figure}

For every extended DAG with a set of probes $\{P_0, P_1, \ldots, P_k\}$, we relax the instrumentation accuracy by selecting a subset of the probes to be removed, subject to the maximum allowed percentage error, $M$.

We model the relaxation as a 0-1 Knapsack problem:
\[
%\textrm{maximise } \sum_{i=0}^{k} f(I_i)c(I_i)x_i
\textrm{maximise } \sum_{i=0}^{k} f(P_i)x_i

%$c(I_i)$ is the relative overhead of the instrumentation on the instrumented basic block,
where $f(P_i)$ is the execution frequency of the instrumented basic block $P_i$, $\varepsilon(P_i)$ is the percentage error of removing probe $P_i$ relative to the minimum work value possible to compute in the extended DAG, and $x_i$ denotes the probes selected for removal.
Because the percentage error is computed based on the path with the minimum amount of work, $\varepsilon(P_i)$ represents the maximum error possible that would be incurred when removing probe $P_i$.
Furthermore, by constraining the percentage error of every extended DAG below a given threshold we guarantee that the final error of the relaxation will always be bounded by the threshold.

While the optimal placement of probes tries to place probes in edges that are less likely to be executed, the relaxation focus on removing probes that are more likely to be executed.
The necessary block frequency information for optimising both the placement of probes can be acquired from profiles of previous executions of the program or by a static heuristic of the CFG during compilation.

For our experiments, we implemented two solvers for the 0-1 Knapsack problem:
the optimal brute-force solver;
the greedy heuristic based on sorting the items ~\cite{dantzig57}.
We use the brute-force solver for DAGs with a small number of probes and the greedy heuristic when the number of probes is greater than a threshold.
Some of the benchmarks have DAGs with several hundreds of probes, which could result in a long compilation time.

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

In this section we discuss our experimental evaluation.
First we describe the benchmarks with datasets used in the experiments.
Afterwards, we discuss our results concerning the instrumentations for profiling our work metric.
Finally we present the results of the online {\itercomp}.

We implemented the instrumentations in LLVM 4.0.
The target platform is a Linux-4.4.27 system with an Intel Core i7-4770 3.40GHz Skylake~CPU with 16~GiB RAM.

\subsection{Benchmarks}

For the experimental evaluation we have used a subset of the \textit{KDataSets} benchmark suit, which is the same benchmark and dataset suit used by Chen~\etal~\cite{chen10,chen12a}.
The KDataSets contains 1000 different inputs for each one of its benchmark programs.
These benchmarks cover a broad spectrum of application scenarios, ranging from simple embedded signal-processing tasks to common mobile-phone and desktop tasks.
The different inputs try to capture distinct characteristics in terms of workload sizes and how these workloads exercise different control flow paths.
A summary of the benchmarks and dataset suit is shown in Table~\ref{tab:kdatasets}.

\end{table}

The shaded (grey) benchmarks in Table~\ref{tab:kdatasets} represent the benchmarks used for training the cost model used for computing the weight of the instructions for the work metric.
These same training benchmarks were also used for collecting a fixed set of optimisations for the {\itercomp}.
The remaining (white) benchmarks are used for the experimental evaluation.

\subsection{Evaluation of the Instrumentation}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/overhead-O3.pdf}
    \caption{Overhead of the instrumentations compiled with {\texttt{-O3}}.}
    \label{fig:overhead-O3}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:instr} shows percentage of instrumented basic blocks for the optimal and the relaxed instrumentation with different relaxation thresholds.
The naive instrumentation always has 100\% of the basic blocks instrumented, by definition.

\begin{figure*}[htp]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/num-probes.pdf}
    \caption{Percentage of instrumented basic blocks for the optimal and the relaxed instrumentation with different relaxation thresholds.}
    \label{fig:num-probes}
\end{figure*}

The \texttt{adpcm\_d} benchmark is the most critical case amongst the used benchmarks, with a overhead of about 66\% with the optimal instrumentation.
This benchmark consists mainly of a single hot loop with several branches inside it.
The relaxation algorithm is able to reduce this overhead down to about 52\% (with an error threshold of 1\%) and 19\% (with an error threshold of 2\%) by removing only one and two probes from the hot loop, respectively.
These two removed probes were placed in branches, inside the hot loop, with a high probability of being taken, but with a small contribution to the work measured in the loop.

%In this section we discuss the three baseline implementations that will be used for assessing the quality of the proposed metric.

%\vspace{1ex}
%\noindent \textbf{{\Itercomp} over a single input}

%Most of the existing {\itercomp} studies find the best optimisation though repeated runs on the same input.
%Although this approach will usually lead to sub-optimal performance across large input datasets, it provides a good baseline when considering the complexity and resonably low compile-time regarding iterative optimising compilers.
%If $M$ is the total number of combinations of compiler optimisations, this approach requires $O(M)$ runs of the program being optimised.
%We can consider two main scenarios:
%\textit{($i$ - best case scenario)} after selecting the optimisation over each individual input, consider the one with best performance across the whole input dataset;
%\textit{($ii$ - expected scenario)} after selecting the optimisation over each individual input, consider the average case of their performance across the whole input dataset.

%\vspace{1ex}
%\noindent \textbf{{\Itercomp} across large input datasets}

%Recent work on {\itercomp} have been targeting optimisation across multiple inputs~\cite{fursin07,chen10,chen12a}.
%If $N$ is the number of input test cases and $M$ is the total number of combinations of compiler optimisations, they perform a total of $O(NM)$ runs of the program being optimised.
%Similarly to what have been discussed previously, there are different ways for how to determine the optimal combination of compiler optimisations across multiple inputs.
%It is possible to tune the selection of the program-optimal combination to minimise risk or to maximise average performance.
%A compromise-based selection criterion could be to maximise average speedup with minimised variance.

%\vspace{1ex}
%\noindent \textbf{{\Itercomp} based on the IPC metric}

%While the previous two baselines addresses two opposite aspects of {\itercomp}, namely, compile-time efficiency and performance of the generated code, we also intend to compare against IPC as the competing baseline.
%The main reason for comparing against IPC is because it has been proposed as a metric for comparing the performance of two optimisations running on two distinct inputs.
%If $M$ is the total number of combinations of compiler optimisations, this approach requires $O(M)$ runs of the program being optimised.

\subsection{Evaluation of the Online {\IterComp}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Oracle-RM executes the program twice, for each input, and then measuring the real speedup for each compiler optimisation and uses the real speedup for selecting the best optimisation.
\item Oracle-PP represents the \textit{perfect} non-intrusive profiling by also executing the program twice, once for estimating the amount of work and the second for measuring its execution time.
This version uses the work-based metric, $\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}$, during the {\itercomp} search.
\end{itemize}

%\subsubsection{Contribution of individual optimisation passes}

%Figure~\ref{fig:flagsfreq} shows an aggregated view of the final combination of compiler optimisations that were selected by {\itercomp} search.
%The figure presents the individual optimisation passes with at least 1\% of frequency in the selected combination of compiler optimisations that improved the performance over {\texttt{-O3}}.

    \caption{Comparison between {\itercomp} using IPC or the WP metric.}
    \label{fig:ipc-vs-work}
\end{figure*}


Figure~\ref{fig:ipc-vs-work} presents a comparison between IPC and the WP metric regarding their correlation with the actual speedup over \verb|-O0| observed during {\itercomp}.
Each point in the figure correspond to each metric averaged over input windows collected during multiple executions of the {\itercomp}.
The vertical lines correspond to the optimisation sequence selected by the {\itercomp} search, which either represents the highest IPC or the highest value of WP.
In all cases, the optimisation sequence selected based on the WP is much closer to the best speedup than the optimisation sequence selected based on IPC, which can be attributed to the fact that the WP have a stronger correlation with the speedup.
In all cases, IPC shows little to no correlation with the speedup, which corroborates the argument given in Section~\ref{sec:ipc-vs-work-metric}.

For some cases, namely for the tiff-related benchmarks, the WP shows a worse correlation with speedup.
We believe these cases could be improved by improving the cost model used to compute the work metric.
However, even in these cases, the optimisation sequence selected based on the WP outperforms those selected based on IPC.


\section{Related Work}

\subsection{{\IterComp}}

Chen~\etal~\cite{chen10,chen12a} evaluate the effectiveness of iterative compilations across a large number of input test cases.
Their main motivation is to answer the question:
\textit{How data input dependent is {\itercomp}?}
Their results show that it is possible to find a combination of compiler optimisations that achieves at least 86\% of the maximum speedup across all input test cases.
These optimal combinations are program-specific and yield average speedups up to 3.75$\times$ over the highest optimisation level of compilers.

When optimising a program, the main method for {\itercomp} used by Chen~\etal~\cite{chen10,chen12a} evaluates each combination of compiler optimisations across all the available inputs, i.e., if $N$ is the number of input test cases and $M$ is the total number of combinations of compiler optimisations, they perform a total of $O(NM)$ runs of the program being optimised.
Furthermore, they use a pre-defined set of only 300 different combinations of compiler optimisations, which represents a very small sample of the optimisation search space for most modern compilers, e.g.
LLVM has 56 distinct optimisation passes and GCC has about 47 high-level (SSA form) optimisation passes and about 25 low-level (RTL) optimisation passes, which in both cases result in much more than $2^{50}$ distinct combinations of compiler optimisations, without considering repetition.

Recent work~\cite{chen12b,fang15} have applied the same idea of performing input-dependent {\itercomp} to distributed applications on data centres.
In summary, each worker receives a subset of the input dataset, called the evaluation dataset, to perform an \textit{online} {\itercomp} of the code being executed.
Each worker performs the same the method for {\itercomp} used by Chen~\etal~\cite{chen10,chen12a}, i.e., they evaluate each combination of compiler optimisations across all the evaluation dataset.
However, because the optimisation is performed online, they usually consider a small evaluation dataset and a small number of compiler optimisations.

Fursin~\etal~\cite{fursin07} addressed the problem of comparing the effect of two optimisations on two distinct inputs. For that purpose, they proposed to use instruction per cycle (IPC) as the metric for performing such comparison.
Their result show that using IPC seems promising as a robust metric for {\itercomp} across large input datasets.
However, some specific optimisation techniques may affect the use of IPC as a robust metric, and specially IPC has been shown to provide poor performance estimation for multi-threaded programs~\cite{alameldeen06,eyerman08}.
In particular, IPC can give a skewed performance measure if threads spend time in \textit{spin-lock loops} or other synchronisation mechanisms. 
Some existing work on performance assessment suggest that total execution time should be used for measuring performance of multi-threaded programs~\cite{alameldeen06,eyerman08}.
Aalameldeen and Wood~\cite{alameldeen06} in particular suggest that a simple work-related metric should be used if the unit of work is representative enough.
Work-related metrics have already been largely used for measuring performance of throughput-oriented applications, for other applications, however, choosing an appropriate unit of work can be more challenging~\cite{alameldeen06}.

\subsection{Work and Input Size Metrics}

Previous work have proposed profiling-based mechanism to estimate input sizes~\cite{zaparanuks12,coppa14}.
Coppa~\etal~\cite{coppa14} in particular propose the concept of \textit{read memory size} for automatically estimating the size of the input passed to a routine, where \textit{read memory size} represents the number of distinct memory cells first accessed by a read operation.
In other words, the \textit{read memory size} metric measures the size of the useful portion of the input's memory footprint.
However, because we are interested in the amount of computational work performed in respect of a given input, the memory footprint of the input may not always have a direct correspondence to  the amount of computational work.

Goldsmith~\etal~\cite{goldsmith07} use \textit{block frequency} as the measure for performance for empirically describing the asymptotic behaviour of programs, which is known as empirical computational complexity.
Block frequency is a relative metric that represents the number of times a basic block executes~\cite{ball94,ball96}.
They argue in favour of block frequency due to its portability, repeatability and exactness, since it does not suffer from timer resolution problems or non-deterministic noises.
Block frequency also has the advantage of being efficiently profiled by means of automatic code instrumentation~\cite{knuth73,ball94}.

However, in the context of comparing different optimisations, although block frequency would be able to capture aspects of optimisations that simplify the control-flow graph (CFG), measuring work at the basic block resolution would not capture effects of optimisations at the instruction level.
Because of that, we extend the idea of using basic block frequency to measure computational work by also considering the computational cost of each basic block.
The computational cost of a basic block is given by weighing the instructions that it contains.

\subsection{Optimal Instrumentation}

In 1973, Donald Knuth~\cite{knuth73} provided an optimal algorithm for profiling block frequency, inserting fewer probes than the previously described naive instrumentation that was commonly used in practice~\cite{knuth71}.
Forman~\cite{forman81} proposed further overhead reductions by placing the probes in basic blocks that are less likely to be executed based on static heuristics.

Ball and Larus~\cite{ball94} offered a detailed discussion comparing two approaches for optimally profiling block frequency, namely, placing probes on the vertices or the edges of the control-flow graph (CFG).
They show that the edge-based approach produces optimal placement of probes.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Our proposed technique for relaxed instrumentation can also be applied for similar profiling scenarios, such as profiling empirical computational complexity~\cite{goldsmith07,zaparanuks12,coppa14}.
